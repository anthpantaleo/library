# Library App

This is the first iteration of a library application. Made while working through The Odin Project. Currently, there is no storage set, but apparently will be coming back to it later.

There is the ability to add books, remove them, and change their marked status. In the future I will work on making them editable from a modal as well as work on local storage.
